#PHP Stubs for php_riak.
Can be used as API documentation or to add autocomplete to phpstorm and other editors.

#Composer
The stubs can now be installed using composer.  
Add the following to your composer.json require section:  
"bach-pedersen/php-riak-stubs": "dev-master"

#Note
master tries to follow php_riak master, so if you install php_riak with pecl you should select the git tag that matches your php_riak version, this is pretty important as the api is changing rather a lot at the momemt.

#Status
Should be all good
