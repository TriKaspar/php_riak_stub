#php_riak_stub
PHP Stubs for php_riak.
Can be used as API documentation or to add autocomplete to phpstorm and other editors.

#Note
master tries to follow php_riak master, so if you install php_riak with pecl you should select the git tag that matches your php_riak version, this is pretty important as the api is changing rather a lot at the momemt.

#Status
Should be all good
